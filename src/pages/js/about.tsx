        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hiya! I'm Kaine, I'm a Developer and Video Editor who loves to make games and passion projects in Unreal Engine,
        along with that have a few side projects made in Typescript which helped me get me to the point where I am today. My availability is always varied but if you'd like to contact me for a business opportunity please contact me using one of the contact methods provided below</p>
        <h2>What Have I done?</h2>
        <p>I've worked on a range of projects, some of which I cannot talk about as they're a secret
        ðŸ¤«<br />But the stuff I can talk about ranges from my very first Steam release which was a procedurally generated space arcade shooter to
        editing short form content to make a mass amount of people laugh at a oneliner</p>
